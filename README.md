## 👋 Hi there, I’m Maksym

I’m a Backend Developer with a Master’s in Computer Engineering and 3.5+ years of experience turning ideas into reliable, scalable systems.

⚡ I enjoy building backend services that can handle growth, automating processes, and diving deep into web scraping and data extraction.

🛠️ I work confidently with databases, caching systems, REST APIs, and asynchronous programming.

🤖 Expertise in Selenium and FastAPI

☁️ Comfortable with cloud deployments, CI/CD pipelines, containers, and Linux environments.

📊 I’ve also worked on internal analytics and data processing, making sense of data and improving workflows.

✍️ Writing clean code and good documentation is important to me, and I love collaborating as part of a team to solve tricky problems.
